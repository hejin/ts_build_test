== Overview

(Temporary) Project URL: https://github.com/lwbt/ts_build_test

[TIP]
====

.This might be a good introduction to GitHub Actions.

The entire functionality here is just one

Read mode about it link:DOCS/PIPELINE.adoc[here].
=====

=== Motivation

Provide automated builds of Tailscale as described in https://tailscale.com/kb/1207/small-tailscale[KB: Small Tailscale] for embedded devices.

* Building a combined binary of `tailscale` and `tailscaled`
* Using the build option `--extra-small`
* Compressing the binary with UPX

== Tailscale Self-Update: How does it work?

[WARNING]
====
Self-Update does not work with these builds.
Your can run the https://github.com/Admonstrator/glinet-tailscale-updater/[updater script] with `yes` (`yes | script`) for updates.
====

On official builds you can use `tailscale update` to do a self-update, or even better Tailscale can do it for you with https://tailscale.com/kb/1067/update#auto-updates[auto-updates].

Another popular program that uses self-updates is Syncthing, and it looks not too complicated:
https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/f08a0ed01c777fbace6d0a47c9c091fd5194f5aa/cmd/infra/stupgrades/main.go#L272[Update]
-> https://github.com/syncthing/syncthing/blob/f08a0ed01c777fbace6d0a47c9c091fd5194f5aa/cmd/infra/stupgrades/main.go#L35[URL].

Tailscale:
https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/blob/ba3523fc3f62835bcddba683e37257ed7d53493c/cmd/tailscale/cli/update.go#L64[runUpdate -> Update]
-> https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/blob/ba3523fc3f62835bcddba683e37257ed7d53493c/clientupdate/clientupdate.go#L262[NewUpdater]
-> Arguments.PkgsAddr -> https://pkgs.tailscale.com. And I think the updates are signed and will be verified.

At the moment, I'm not sure if self-updates can be implemented without touching more than just the URL in the code base.
It would be nice to have, but doing such kinds of patches opens the door to do other sketchy things.

* Original URL pattern: https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/?v=1.76.6#static[] -> https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/tailscale_1.76.6_arm64.tgz
* Custom URL pattern: https://github.com/lwbt/ts_build_test/releases/tag/v1.76.6[] -> https://github.com/lwbt/ts_build_test/releases/download/v1.76.6/tailscaled-linux-arm64

== Do it yourself

=== Costs

* https://github.com/settings/billing/summary[Billing Summary] -- Pipeline minutes and packages
* https://github.com/settings/billing/spending_limit[Spending Limits] -- By default it should have a spending limit of 0, so you will not get billed but the functionalities will stop working when exceeding a limit. I have to figure out by myself how much on an impact this has, a I currently interpret it, I won't hit the monthly pipeline minutes limit and outgoing data transfer for public packages seems to be free?

Pipeline consumption:

* You can run the check every hour which takes about 30 seconds
* If a build is created it will take about a total of 7 minutes, 2 minutes per architecture, and you will be "billed" 7 minutes, which means you will have 7 minutes left to use this month

=== Notifications

If you clone the repository and run the workflow on your account, you will
receive email from GitHub when a new release was created. You will also see
that, while the cron definition says run every hour at 00 Minutes, that a
runner will sometimes start and complete a few minutes later.

=== Fork

TODO

=== Re-create

Here are the basic individual steps if you don't want to fork:

[source,bash]
----
# Login to GitHub (necessary on the first run)
gh auth login -h github.com -p HTTPS -w

# Create a new repo on GitHub
REPO="ts_build_test"
gh repo create ${REPO} --private

# Verify that the new repo exists
gh repo list

# TODO
# Do a git clone of the new repo here? GH already gives you the URL.

# Create folder structure for workflows
mkdir -pv .github/workflows

# TODO
# Do a git push of the new repo here?
----

=== Required Settings

Setting -> Actions -> General -> Workflow permissions
-> "Read and write permissions"
(default: "Read repository contents and packages permissions")

[source,bash]
----
OWNER="lwbt"
REPO="ts_build_test"
gh api \
  --method PUT \
  -H "Accept: application/vnd.github+json" \
  -H "X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28" \
